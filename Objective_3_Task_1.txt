										Objective 3: ALGORITHM 

	Task 1: Implement an algorithm for determining if an Nth is a divisor of an n Number (i.e. 2 is a divisor of 6). If so, determine if itâ€™s an even number or odd number as well. 


1. Ask the user to enter N
2. Ask the user to enter n
3. If we take N mod n and the result is 0 then that means N is a divisor of n
4. Afterwards, to determine if it is even or odd, we take N mod 2 and if the result is 0, the divisor is even. If it is not 0, then the divisor is odd.
5. Finally, we present the solution to the problem using clear and proper English.
